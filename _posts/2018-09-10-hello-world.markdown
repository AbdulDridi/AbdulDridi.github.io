## Welcome!

So... to start off with, a little bit about me. My name is Abdurrahman (Abdul if it makes it any easier!) Dridi, at the time of writing I am a computer science student at the University of Manchester due to graduate in December 2018. My hobbies include programming, lifting weights, reading books and playing competitive shooter games (mainly CS:GO).

Now that we have that out of the way, let me answer what is by now likely to be your most pressing question!

#### What can you expect to see and read on my blog?

I realise that since this is literally my first blog post, the chances of someone stumbling upon it and asking this question is quite low. However, if this is you, consider this your lucky day my friend because I'm about to take you on a journey!

Actually, scrap that, I'll just answer the question. This blog is primarily a way for me to learn a little more effectively, I've recently gotten more interested in the fields of machine learning and natural language processing, and will be writing summaries and explanatory pieces in order to solidify my understanding. As a result, there will no doubt be some errors in my write ups (despite my efforts against it- or not, depending on your opinion of me!), so if you do spot any, please do let me know!

I'll probably also include summaries, thoughts and reflections (if I manage to conjure some up for once) of the various books I read (which you can find on my [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/77881457-abdurrahman-dridi) page), that's all I can think of for now.

Adios Amigos!
